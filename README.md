# PNG - Project Number Generator

PNG is a CLI program created to generate unique IDs for Harmony's project report sheets. The ids generated by this program have the format: `AAA-BB-#`, where:

- `AAA` is a three uppercase letter code identifying the team responsible for the project
- `BB` is a two uppercase letter code identifying the type of work
- `#` is a unique number

Upon first initialiation, it'll create a `png.sqlite` file in the same directory as the executable. This is its internal database file, that should be backed up from time to time to avoid loss of data.

The database comes preloaded with the following teams and work types:

- Teams
  - FOR
  - ANA
  - MIC
  - PRO
- Work Types
  - MA
  - ES
  - IC
  - PT
  - PP

## Instalation

### Windows

1. Build or download the `png.exe` file from the releases page.
2. Create a `png` directory in `C:\Program Files` and place it there (or any other directory of your choosing).
3. [Edit the `PATH` environment variable](https://www.howtogeek.com/787217/how-to-edit-environment-variables-on-windows-10-or-11/) to also point to the newly created `png` directory.

## Usage

If you execute PNG without any parameters it will start in interactive mode, prompting the user for actions to take. Commands can also be invoked directly via its CLI API. Check the help page (`png -h` or `png --help`) for more information on the availabe options.
